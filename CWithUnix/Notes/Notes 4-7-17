Network communication

min requirement
	address of receiving computer
	address of receiving user
	address of sender
	message

Fat client
	accepts user request, transfers request to server
	server sends all data for request
	client processes data
	client presents results

Thin client
	like fat client
	server processes data and returns to client

Sockets (pipes pg 24)
	TCP - transport control protocol
	UDP - user data gram protocol

	#include <sys/socket.h>
	#include <arpa/inet.h>
	truct sockaddr_in {
		int16_t sin_family;           //AF_INET is Ipv4 socket stream SOCK_STREAM
		unit16_t sin_port;            // server port address
		struct in_addr sin_addr;  // INADDR_ANY to accept all connections
		char sin_zero[8];
	};
