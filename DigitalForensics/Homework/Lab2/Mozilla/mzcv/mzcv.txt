Description
===========

MZCookiesView is an alternative to the standard 'Cookie Manager' provided
by Netscape and Mozilla browsers. It displays the details of all cookies
stored inside the cookies file (cookies.txt) in one table, and allows you
to save the cookies list into text, HTML or XML file, delete unwanted
cookies, and backup/restore the cookies file.



Notice:
=======

The name of this tool was changed from MozillaCookiesView to
MZCookiesView due to the obsession of Mozilla Foundation people with
their registered trademark. I have received a threatening letter from the
attorney of Mozilla Foundation saying that using the 'Mozilla' word
inside the name of my software infringes their trademark rights and
demanding that I'll change the name of this tool.
In order to avoid from any trouble in the future, I decided to change the
name of this tool to MZCookiesView.



System Requirement
==================

MZCookiesView works properly in all versions of Windows (Windows 9x/ME,
Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP) and it can read the cookies
file created by any version of Netscape/Mozilla browser. However, If you
have an old version of Netscape or Mozilla, you'll have to locate the
cookies file (cookies.txt) by yourself, and then select it by using the
'Select Cookies File / Folder' option.

Using MZCookiesView
===================

MZCookiesView doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLLs. In order to start using it, just copy the executable (mzcv.exe) to
any folder you like, and run it.
If you have an advanced version of Mozilla or Netscape browsers,
MZCookiesView automatically locates your cookies file and displays the
list of all cookies stored in there. If you have more than one profile in
your browser, you can view the cookies of other profiles by using the
'Select User Profile' option. If MZCookiesView fails to automatically
find your cookies file, you can still select the cookies file manually,
by using the 'Select Cookies File / Folder' option.

In the main window of MZCookiesView, you can easily select one or more
cookies, and then delete them, copy the cookies information to the
clipboard, or save them to text, HTML, or XML file.



Command-Line Options
====================



-cookiesfile <Filename>
Opens MZCookiesView with the specified cookies filename.

-profilesfolder <Folder>
Opens MZCookiesView with the specified profiles folder.

/stext <Filename>
Save the cookies list into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the cookies list into a tab-delimited text file.

/stabular <Filename>
Save the cookies list into a tabular text file.

/shtml <Filename>
Save the cookies list into HTML file (Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save the cookies list into HTML file (Vertical).

/sxml <Filename>
Save the cookies list to XML file.

/scookiestxt <Filename>
Save the cookies list in cookies.txt format.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Value" and "Name". You can specify the '~' prefix character (e.g:
"~Name") if you want to sort in descending order. You can put multiple
/sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple columns.

Examples:
mzcv.exe /shtml "f:\temp\cookies.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
mzcv.exe /shtml "f:\temp\cookies.html" /sort "Domain/Host" /sort "Name"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.

Examples:
mzcv.exe -cookiesfile "C:\Documents and
Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Mozilla\Profiles\default\1ac13dos.s
lt\cookies.txt"
mzcv.exe -profilesfolder "C:\Documents and Settings\User1\Application
Data\Phoenix\Profiles"
mzcv.exe /shtml "c:\temp\cookies-list.html" -cookiesfile
"c:\netscape\cookies.txt"



Translating MZCookiesView To Another Language
=============================================

MZCookiesView allows you to easily translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and
other strings to other languages.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run MZCookiesView with /savelangfile parameter:
   mzcv.exe /savelangfile
   A file named mzcv_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   MZCookiesView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to the
   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run MZCookiesView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file. If you want
   to run MZCookiesView without the translation, simply rename the
   language file, or move it to another folder.
