What is DF IA

Digital forensics
    a branch of forensics science
        scientific tests used in connection with the detection of a crime
    legal evidence found in computers and network devices and more
        what information is here
        what caused this situation
    digital forensics >= computer forensics

DF application
    Criminal Investigation
        BTK killer - "can i communicate with floppy and not be traced by computer?"
            yes
    Civil Litigation
        Discovery of digital evidence in civil cases
    Intelligence
        positive - Counter terrorism
        negative - PRISM, Edward Snowden
    Administration
        Collecting evidence of computer abuse by employees
    
The forensic process
    Preparation
        investigator must be properly trained to perform specific kind of investigation
        tools should be validated
            EnCase - Guidence Software
            forensic Toolkit (FTK) - Access Data
            Open Source DF Tools: SANS SIFT, The sleuth kit
    Collection
        where is the digital evidence?
            storage medium
            electronic document
            packets moving over network
            web browsing histories
            frequently searched phrases
            paired devices
Special handling of collecting digital evidence
    most digital information changes easily and frequently
    difficult to detect a change that has taken place
    calculate and store a hash of evidence file for later comparison
    handle original data as little as possible
        create image
    establish and maintain chain of custody
    document everything that has been done
    only use tools and methods that have been tested and evaluated to validate their accuracy and reliability

    Some of the most valueble information obtained in the cocurse of a forensic ecamination will come from the computers user
    
Imaging/Verifying Digital Evidence
    the process of creating an exact duplicate of the original media
    verify the image
        use hash algos to compare original and image

Analysis
    all digital evidence must be analyzed to determine the type of information that is stored upon it
        use specialty tools

Reporting
    once analysis is complete, report is generated
        modern forensic tools can generate automated reports

Examples of DF 
    Chandra Levy
        intern dissapeared in April 30, 2001
        used web and email, was traced
    BTK killer
        Dennis Rader
        traced by floppy

Information Assurance Definition
    Conducting operations that protect and defend information 
        confidentiality
        integrity
        availability
        authentication

Confidentiality
    holding sensative data in confidence
    privacy or data security

Integrity
    maintaining consistency, accurancy and trustworthyness of data
        System integrity
        data integrity
    countermeasure
        user access control
        checksum/hash

Availability
    state where information is in the place needed by the user, at the time needed, and form needed
    issues
        system reliability
        timely delivery
    countermeasure
        redundancy
        firewalls

Authentication
    verify identity of user, device, or other system
    countermeasure

Non-Repudiation
    cannot deny involvement or actions

    3 types
        origin
            cant deny one sent a message
        submission
            message transit point cannot deny a message was submitted for delivery
        delivery
            cannot deny receiving a message
