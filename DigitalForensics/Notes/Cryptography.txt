Cryptography

Motivations
    to be secure

    confidentiality
    integrity
    availability

    Cryptography lays the foundation for modern IA
    it is the prerequisite for most digital forensics

Terminologies
    Cryptography
        art of hiding information into apparent unintelligibility
        enables information exchange between 2 participants in a way that prevents others from reading it
    plain text, ciphertext, encryption, decryption
    
Secret Algorithms
    how to create and algo that is not known to anybody
        how hard to make secure?
        how hard to make it last?
        how applicable is it?
        real world example?
    what are alternatives
        is it better for security?
        will it last longer?
        real world example

Computational Difficulty
    Algorithms are not imposible to break

    this in in the notes....
