Notes 3/2/17
Data Structures
Burris

Folding (pg 157)
	divide to prevent overflow
	add 2 char strings

	division remainder hashing

square and extract hashing (pg 158)
	extract middle 8 bits for 256 size hashtable
	hash = (abs(sum)/2^12) % 2^8

collision handling (pg 159)
	2 objects hash the same location
		need to find new location for 2nd
		can reclaim space if 1st deleted?
		what happens to 2nd?

	linear collision probe
	when deleting, replace with char other than (pg 161)default - i.e. "###" (still empty)

	random probe (pg 163)
	r=1
	tableSize = 8
	2^n=8 ---- n=3

	r*=5
	r%=32
	p[i]=r/4
