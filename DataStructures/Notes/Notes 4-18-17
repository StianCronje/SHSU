Data Structures
Burris

heap sort
    log[2](n)
    uses too much space

AVL Tree (self balancing binary tree)
    sons = 2j & 2j+1
    father = floor(j/2)

shell sort
    best for natureal order

super sort
    combine all the sort algos based on most efficient entry counts

hash sort
    scatter write
    gather read

Radix sort
    sort by mod Radix
    sort by div Radix
    needs radix amt buckets

    numbers -> 10 buckets 0-9
    words -> 26 buckets a-z

    need amt digit passes
    26 -> 2 passes
    ABCD -> 4 passes
