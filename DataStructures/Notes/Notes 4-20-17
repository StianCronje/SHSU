Data Structures
Burris

Straight Insertion
    same as bubble sort
    fastest way to do bubble sort

Pointer Sort
    sort an array of pointers

Priority Queue (pg 181)
    on a disk, faster to serve requests closer to each other
    builds queue, but sorts it (not a true queue)
    uses heap data structure
