Shift Instructions
	opcode destination, 1
	opcode destination, cl

	Left Shift
		SHL dest, cl
		shifts all bits left
		0 moves in from right
		SF, PF, ZF are set approriately
		CF = last bit shifted out
		OF = set if result changes

		left shift mult by power of 2
		use SAL if mult is intended

	Right Shift
		RHL dest, cl
		shifts all bits right
		0 moves in from left
		SF, PF, ZF are set approriately
		CF = last bit shifted out
		OF = set if result changes

		right shift devides by power of 2
		use SAR if signed dev was intended 
		sign bit is kept

Rotate Instructions
	ROL (rotate left)
		shifts bits left
		leftmost moves to rightmost and CF
	ROR (rotate right)
		shofts bits right
		rightmost moves to leftmost and CF

	RCL (rorate through carry left)
		shifts bits left
		leftmost moves CF
		CF moves to rightmost
	RCR (rorate through carry right)
		shifts bits left
		rightmost moves CF
		CF moves to leftmost
